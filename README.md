## What are Agentic Workflows?

Agentic workflows are automated processes that involve autonomous agents—intelligent systems capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions independently to achieve specific goals. These workflows often leverage AI, machine learning, and decision-making algorithms to handle complex tasks without constant human intervention. They are designed for efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in domains such as research, automation, and problem-solving.
